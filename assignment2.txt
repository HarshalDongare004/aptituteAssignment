1. What quantity of water should be added to the milk water mixture so that
the milk water ratio changes from 2:3 to 4:11. The quantity of milk in the
mixture is 40 litres?
SOLUTION:

The current ratio of milk to water is 2:3, which means that there is 2/5 = 40% milk 
and 3/5 = 60% water in the mixture. If we add water to the mixture, the percentage of milk will 
decrease and the percentage of water will increase.

The new ratio of milk to water is 4:11, which means that there is 4/15 = 26.67% milk 
and 11/15 = 73.33% water in the mixture.

To find the amount of water that needs to be added, we can use the following equation:

(Percentage of water in new mixture) - (Percentage of water in current mixture) = (Amount of water added)/(Total volume of mixture)

Plugging in the values, we get:
0.7333 - 0.6 = (Amount of water added)/(40 liters)
0.1333 = (Amount of water added)/(40 liters)
(Amount of water added) = 0.1333 * 40 liters
(Amount of water added) = 5.33 liters
Therefore, 5.33 liters of water must be added to the milk-water mixture to change the ratio of milk to water from 2:3 to 4:11.


2. Linear equation 2x+3y=0 meets the x & y-axis at the point?
SOLUTION:

The linear equation 2x+3y=0 meets the x-axis at the point (3,0) and the y-axis at the point (0,-2).

To find the point where the line meets the x-axis, we can set y=0 and solve for x. 
This gives us the equation 2x=0, which has the solution x=0. 
Substituting this value of x into the original equation, we get 2(0)+3y=0, which simplifies to 3y=0.
 Therefore, y=0 at the point where the line meets the x-axis.

To find the point where the line meets the y-axis, we can set x=0 and solve for y.
 This gives us the equation 3y=0, which has the solution y=0. 
Substituting this value of x into the original equation, we get 2(0)+3(0)=0, which is always true. 
Therefore, y=0 at the point where the line meets the y-axis.

3. a & b are positive integers such that a^2-b^=19. Find a & b?
SOLUTION:
The two positive integers a and b such that a^2-b^2=19 are 10 and 9.

To solve for a and b, we can use the following equation:
a^2-b^2=(a+b)(a-b)
We know that a^2-b^2=19, so we can substitute this value into the equation above. This gives us:

19=(a+b)(a-b)
We know that both a and b are positive integers, so (a+b) and (a-b) must be two integers that multiply to 19. The only two pairs of integers that satisfy this condition are (10,1) and (9,2).

Since a and b must be positive integers, we can conclude that a=10 and b=9.


4. Find a^+b^3+c^3+3abc , where a+b+c=5 & , a^2+b^2+c^2=10?
SOLUTION:
a^3+b^3+c^3 = 3abc + (a+b+c)(a^2+b^2+c^2-ab-ac-bc)
We know that a+b+c=5 and a^2+b^2+c^2=10, so we can substitute these values into the identity above. This gives us:
a^3+b^3+c^3 = 3abc + (5)(10-ab-ac-bc)
We also know that ab+ac+bc = (a+b+c)^2 - 2(a^2+b^2+c^2) = 5^2 - 2(10) = -5.

Substituting this value into the equation above, we get:
a^3+b^3+c^3 = 3abc + (5)(10-(-5))
a^3+b^3+c^3 = 3abc + 75
abc = (a+b+c)^3 - a^3-b^3-c^3
Substituting the values of a+b+c and a^3+b^3+c^3 into the equation above, we get:
abc = (5)^3 - 75
abc = 50
a^3+b^3+c^3+3abc = 50 + 3(50)
a^3+b^3+c^3+3abc = 200
Therefore, the value of a^3+b^3+c^3+3abc is 200.




5. Sum of two, two-digit numbers is a perfect square. The digits of the first
two-digit number are two consecutive positive integers; also, when the digits
of the first number are reversed, the second number is formed. Find these
numbers & the square root of their sum.
SOLUTION:
	
The two numbers are 12 and 21, and the square root of their sum is 14.

To solve this, we can use the following steps:

List all the two-digit numbers that are formed by two consecutive positive integers.
For each number, reverse the digits and see if the new number is also a two-digit number.
For each pair of numbers that satisfy the conditions, find the sum of the two numbers.
The square root of the sum of the two numbers is the answer.
12 and 21
13 and 31
14 and 41
15 and 51
The only pair of numbers that satisfies the condition that the sum of the two numbers is a 
perfect square is 12 and 21. The sum of 12 and 21 is 33, which is a perfect square. 
The square root of 33 is 11.7, which is approximately 14.
 Therefore, the two numbers are 12 and 21, and the square root of their sum is 14.
