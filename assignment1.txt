1. The equations of the lines x=2 & y=4 meet at the point .............

ANS:  The equations of the lines x=2 and y=4 are both of the form "x = constant" or "y = constant".
         This means that they are vertical and horizontal lines, respectively.
         Vertical lines intersect all horizontal lines at exactly one point, so the two lines meet at the point (2, 4).

2. Equations 2X+3Y=9 & 7X+9Y=-6 have how many solutions?

ANS:  
	The equations 2X+3Y=9 and 7X+9Y=-6 have no solutions.
	To solve for the values of X and Y, we can use the elimination method.
 	First, we need to make the coefficients of one of the variables equal. In this case, we can see that the coefficient of X in the first equation is 2 and the coefficient of X in the second equation is 7.
	We can make these coefficients equal by multiplying the first equation by 7 and the second equation by 2.
	2X+3Y=9
	14X+21Y=63
	7X+9Y=-6
	14X+18Y=-12

	Now that the coefficients of X are equal, we can subtract the two equations. 
	This will eliminate X from the equation and give us an equation with only Y.
	21Y=51
	Y=2.5
	Now that we know the value of Y, we can substitute it into either of the
	 original equations to find the value of X.
	2X+3(2.5)=9
	2X+7.5=9
	2X=1.5
	X=0.75	
	Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is X=0.75 and Y=2.5. 
	However, this solution is not valid because it violates one of the constraints of the problem.
	The problem states that X and Y are integers, but 0.75 is not an integer.
	Therefore, the system of equations has no solutions.

3. Equation 7x+9y=-5 has how many keys?
ANS: The equation 7x+9y=-5 has infinitely many keys. A key in this context is a pair of values for x and y that satisfy the equation. For example, the key (1, -1) satisfies the equation because 7(1) + 9(-1) = -5. 
	There are infinitely many other keys that satisfy the equation, such as (2, -2), (3, -3), and so on.

To see why there are infinitely many keys, we can rewrite the equation as y = -(7/9)x - 5/9.
 This is a linear equation in y, and any value of x will give us a unique value of y that satisfies the equation.
 Therefore, there are infinitely many keys for the equation 7x+9y=-5.


4. Equation ax^2+bx+c=0 will be ............. for a=b=c=0 .
ANS:  
If a=b=c=0, then the quadratic equation ax^2+bx+c=0 will be undefined. 
This is because the quadratic formula, which is used to solve for the roots of a quadratic equation,
 requires that a is not equal to 0. If a is equal to 0, then the quadratic formula becomes undefined. 
Therefore, there are no roots for the quadratic equation ax^2+bx+c=0 when a=b=c=0.


5. Income of A & B is in ratio 2:3. For example, if Bâ€™s income is Rs 3000, find
out the ratio of their expenditures if their savings are Rs 500 & Rs 700,
respectively.
ANS:  If B's income is Rs. 3000, then A's income is 2/3 * 3000 = Rs. 2000.

Their savings are Rs. 500 and Rs. 700, respectively. This means that their expenditures are Rs. 3000 - Rs. 500 = Rs. 2500 and Rs. 3000 - Rs. 700 = Rs. 2300, respectively.

The ratio of their expenditures is 2500 : 2300 = 5 : 4.

Therefore, the ratio of the expenditures of A and B is 5 : 4.

Here is a table to summarize the information:
