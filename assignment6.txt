1. A does 4/5 th of work in 3/5 of time as compared to B. Together they finish the work
in 12 days. In how many days A alone will complete the work?
solution:
work from A = 4/5 compared to B
time taken by A = 3/5 compared to B
A + B = 12

Efficiency From A = 1/time taken
 = 5/3

Time taken from A = 12 * 5/3
 	= 20 days
Therefore 20 days required to complete the work from Alone A.

2. 1 men , 3 women and 4 children finish work in 96 hour while 2 men and 8 children
finish the work in 80 hours, and 2 men and 3 women finish the same work in 120
hours. Find the time in which the work can be completed by 10 men and 5 women?
solution:
1 man, 3 women and 4 children finish work in 96 hour while 2 men and 8 children finish the work in 80 hours, and 2 men and 3 women finish the same work in 120 hours.

Let 1 man do m work in 1 hour, 1 woman do w work in 1 hour and 1 child do c work in 1 hour.

Then, m + 3w + 4c = 1/96 work in 1 hour
2m + 8c = 1/80 work in 1 hour
2m + 3w = 1/120 work in 1 hour

Solving these equations, we get m = 1/480 work in 1 hour, w = 1/720 work in 1 hour and c = 1/960 work in 1 hour.

Therefore, 10 men and 5 women do 10m + 5w = 10/480 + 5/720 = 1/36 work in 1 hour.

Hence, 10 men and 5 women can complete the work in 36 hours.



3. The sales of a cinema ticket increase by 57 1/7 %, and the price of tickets also
increases by 16 2/3%. Find the percentage increase in the revenue collection?
solution:
The percentage increase in the sales of a cinema ticket is 57 1/7 % = 400/7 %.
The percentage increase in the price of tickets is 16 2/3 % = 50/3 %.

The percentage increase in the revenue collection is (400/7 + 50/3) / 100 = 26.16666666666667%.

Therefore, the percentage increase in the revenue collection is 26.16666666666667%.

4. In a garrison, there was sufficient food for 1600 soldiers for 60 days. Each soldier
consumes 900 grams of food every day. After 40 days, 400 soldiers left the camp.
How long the food will last for the remaining soldiers if they consume 1000 grams of
food every day.
solution:
The total food consumed by 1600 soldiers in 60 days is 160090060 = 86400000 grams.
After 40 days, the remaining food is 86400000 - 160090040 = 43200000 grams.
The number of soldiers left in the camp is 1600-400 = 1200.
The number of grams of food consumed by each soldier every day is 1000 grams.
The number of days the food will last for the remaining soldiers is 43200000 / 1200*1000 = 4 days.

So the answer is 4


5. A dealer sold a bicycle at a profit of 10%. Had he bought the bicycle at 10% less price
and sold it at a price Rs. 60 more, he would have gained 25%. The cost price of the
bicycle was?
solution:
Let the cost price of the bicycle be Rs. x.

When the dealer sold the bicycle at a profit of 10%, he got Rs. 1.1x.

If he had bought the bicycle at 10% less price, the cost price would have been Rs. 0.9x.

If he had sold the bicycle at a price Rs. 60 more, he would have got Rs. 1.25 * 0.9x = Rs. 1.125x.

We know that 1.1x = 1.125x + 60

=> 0.025x = 60

=> x = 60/0.025 = 2400

Therefore, the cost price of the bicycle is Rs. 2400.

Here is the solution in a more mathematical way:

Let the cost price of the bicycle be Rs. x.

The dealer sold the bicycle at a profit of 10%, so the selling price was Rs. 1.1x.

If he had bought the bicycle at 10% less price, the cost price would have been Rs. 0.9x.

He would have gained 25% if he had sold the bicycle at a price Rs. 60 more, so the new selling price would have been Rs. 1.25 * 0.9x = Rs. 1.125x.

We know that 1.1x = 1.125x + 60

=> 0.025x = 60

=> x = 2400

Therefore, the cost price of the bicycle is Rs. 2400.
