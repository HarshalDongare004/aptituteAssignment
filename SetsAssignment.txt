2. There are 20000 people living in Defence Colony, Gurgaon. Out of them 9000 subscribe to Star TV Network and 12000 to Zee TV Network. If 4000 subscribe to both, how many do not subscribe to any of the two?
       A.5000
       B.2000 
       C.3000 

SOLUTION :

3. In the Indian athletic squad sent to the Olympics, 21 athletes were in the triathlon team; 26 were in the pentathlon team; and 29 were in the marathon team. 14 athletes can take part in triathlon and pentathlon; 12 can take part in marathon and triathlon; 15 can take part in pentathlon and marathon; and 8 can take part in all the three games. How many were in the marathon team only?
             A.11
             B.10
             C.8
             D.9
SOLUTION:
Total = Triathlon + Pentathlon + Marathon - (Triathlon + Pentathlon) - (Marathon + Triathlon) - (Pentathlon + Marathon) + (All three)
Total = 21 + 26 + 29 - 14 - 12 - 15 + 8
Total = 57
Marathon only = 57 - 21 - 26 = 10

So the answer is 10.

4. 5% of the passengers who boarded Guwahati- New Delhi Rajdhani Express on 20 th February, 2002 do not like coffee, tea and ice cream and 10% like all the three. 20% like coffee and tea, 25% like ice cream and coffee and 25% like ice cream and tea. 55% like coffee, 50% like tea and 50 % like ice cream. The number of passengers who like only coffee is greater than the passengers who like only ice cream by
            A.100
             B.15
            C.50
            D.18
SOLUTION:
Total passengers = 100%
Do not like coffee, tea and ice cream = 5%
Like all three = 10%
Like coffee and tea = 20%
Like ice cream and coffee = 25%
Like ice cream and tea = 25%
Like coffee = 55%
Like tea = 50%
Like ice cream = 50%

Like only coffee = 55% - 20% - 10% = 25%
Like only tea = 50% - 25% - 10% = 15%
Like only ice cream = 50% - 25% - 10% = 15%

ANSWER is B.

Not in any game = 57
In only one game = 37
In both Cricket and Hockey = 10
In both Hockey and Badminton = 9
In both Cricket and Badminton = 13

All three games = 160 - 57 - 37 - 10 - 9 - 13
= 34

Answer:  D


10.In a class of 100 students, every student has passed in one or more of the three subjects, i.e. History, Economics and English. Among all the students, 24 students have passed in English only, 14 students have passed in History only, 11 students have passed in both English and Economics only, and 12 students have passed in both English and History only. A total of 50 students have passed in History. If only 5 students have passed in all three subjects, then how many students have passed in Economics only?
 
A.15
B.18
C.20
D.10
solution:
Total students = 100
Passed in English only = 24
Passed in History only = 14
Passed in both English and Economics only = 11
Passed in both English and History only = 12
Passed in History = 50
Passed in all three subjects = 5

Passed in Economics only = 100 - 24 - 14 - 11 - 12 + 5
= 15

Answer : A

12. Find the solution set of the equation x2+x+2=0 in roster form
a. {1,-2} 
   b. { }   
  c. {1,1}  
  d. {1}
 Solution:
To solve for x, we can factor the equation x2+x+2=0. This gives us (x+2)(x+1)=0. Therefore, x=-2 or x=-1.

In roster form, the solution set is {-2, 1}.
Answer : A


13. 60 students participated in one or more of the three competitions, i.e. Quiz, Extempore and Debate. A total of 22 students participated either in Quiz only or in Extempore only. 4 students participated in all three competitions. A total of14 students participated in any of the two competitions only. How many students participated in Debate only?
A.11
B.20
C.14
D.22

Total students = 60
Quiz only or Extempore only = 22
All three competitions = 4
Any of the two competitions only = 14

Debate only = 60 - 22 - 4 - 14
= 20
Answer : B

15. Convert the A= {3,-3}into set-builder form
a. A= {x:x is a positive integer and is a divisor of 19}
b. A= {x:x is an integer and x2-9=0}
c. A= {x:x is an integer and x+1=1}
d. None of these

A = {x: x is an integer and x = 3 or x = -3}
Option a is incorrect because 19 is not a divisor of 3 or -3.

Option b is incorrect because x2-9=0 does not have integer solutions other than 3 and -3.

Option c is incorrect because x+1=1 does not have any integer solutions other than 0.

Therefore, the correct set-builder form for A={3,-3} is:
A = {x: x is an integer and x = 3 or x = -3}
Answer : d;

16.  Set P comprises all multiples of 4 less than 500. Set Q comprises all odd multiples of 7 less than 500, Set R comprises all multiples of 6 less than 500. How many elements are present in P∪Q∪R ?
A. 202
B. 243
C. 228
D. 186
solution:
n(P∪Q∪R) = n(P) + n(Q) + n(R) - n(P∩Q) - n(Q∩R) - n(R∩P) + n(P∩Q∩R)
n(P∪Q∪R) = 124 + 71 + 83 - 14 - 14 - 14 + 7
= 202

Answer : A

18.  Of the members of three athletic teams in a school 21 are in the cricket team, 26 are in the hockey team and 29 are in the football team. Among them, 14 play hockey and cricket, 15 play hockey and football, and 12 play football and cricket. Eight play all the three games. The total number of members in the three athletic teams is
(a) 43
(b) 76
(c) 49
(d) None of these
n(A∪B∪C) = n(A) + n(B) + n(C) - n(A∩B) - n(B∩C) - n(C∩A) + n(A∩B∩C)

n(A∪B∪C) = 21 + 26 + 29 - 14 - 15 - 12 + 8
= 43

Answer : a 


19.  The set of intelligent students in a class is

20.  In a class of 30 pupils, 12 take needle work, 16 take physics and 18 take history. If all the 30 students take at least one subject and no one takes all three then the number of pupils taking 2 subjects is
(a) 16
(b) 6
(c) 8
(d) 20
n(A∪B∪C) = n(A) + n(B) + n(C) - n(A∩B) - n(B∩C) - n(C∩A) + n(A∩B∩C)
n(A∪B∪C) = 12 + 16 + 18 - 0 - 0 - 0 + 0
= 46

The number of pupils taking one subject is 46−30=16.

Therefore, the number of pupils taking two subjects is 30−16=8.
Answer : c
